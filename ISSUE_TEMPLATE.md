### Explain the issue

Most issues are related to bugs or problems. In these cases, you should
include a minimal working example and a minimal vimrc file (see below), as
well as:

1. Steps to reproduce
2. Expected behaviour
3. Observed behaviour

If your issue is instead a feature request or anything else, please
consider if minimal examples and vimrc files might still be relevant.
